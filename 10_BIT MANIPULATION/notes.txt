1. x >> k means the binary bits of x has to be moved to right by k bits
2. x >> k = x/(2^k)
3. Integer stores in 32 bits. Out of it, 31st bit is reserved for sign. 0 for +ve and 1 for -ve.
4. To store the negative values, the computer stores by taking the 2s complement of the number
5. x << k = x * 2^k
