// 3 rules to apply to time complexity analysis
// 1. find the worst case
// 2. remove constants
// 3. avoid lower value

// we use worst case scenario in Big-O notation as it gives the maximum time the algorithm would take and it will allow us to analyze the performance of the algorithm in the worst case scenario
