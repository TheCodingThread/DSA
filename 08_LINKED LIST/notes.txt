I. 1D
    1. The elements of a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations
    2. We can change the size of a linked list
    3. The starting point is known as the head
    4. With every element, we also store a 'next' that points to the next elemnent's memory location
    5. As the last element or 'tail' will not point to anything, 'next' will be defined as 'nullptr'
    6. For a 32-bit system, a node takes 8 bytes(1 data and ptr)
       For a 64-bit system, a node takes 12 bytes
    7. Whenever it is said that a linked list is given it means the head of the ll is given
