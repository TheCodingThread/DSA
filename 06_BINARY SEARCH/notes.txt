1. Binary search is only applicable in sorted space.

2. Algorithm - i. low = 0 and high = n-1
              ii. mid = (low+high)/2
             iii. if mid == target return mid
              iv. else check if target is > or < than mid
               v. if target > mid, then low = mid+1 else high = mid-1
              vi. Recursively call the function to continue the same process, till mid = target
             vii. if high becomes < low, then it implies that the target doesn't exist in the array
